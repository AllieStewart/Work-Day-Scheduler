## What I Have Learned
I've learned a lot about using jQuery to make life easier, as well as how
localStorage works within a browser to store and retrieve input information.

## Credits
Made by Allie Stewart.
I learned a lot of info about jQuery and localStorage from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript and https://www.w3schools.com/js/, as well as helpful
info from the student mini-project from module 5.
